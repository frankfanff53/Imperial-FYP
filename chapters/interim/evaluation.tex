For the model evaluation I would like to have the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop the multi-class segmentation model, and set the trained model as the initial baseline model.
    \item Adapt the new pre-training task to the proxy task and compare the performance with the target model with new proxy task with the baseline model.
    \item Compare the performance of the new proxy model and the proxy model implemented with methods in the prior work
\end{enumerate}
