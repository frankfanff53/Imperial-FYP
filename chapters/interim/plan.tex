For the project plan, I would like to divide the project into 4 phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of the Crohn's Data and Replicate the results for the prior work.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I will use MRI volumes, ground-truth segmentation masks and centerline coordinates for this project. Ground-truth labels for the multi-class segmentation need further discussion with the project supervisor.
        \item For replicating the prior work, a further discussion about using available GPU resources is required.
        \item In this phase, a checkpoint meeting/email is required every two weeks. The deadline for this phase is the end of February.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Phase 2: Develop the multi-class segmentation model based on the prior work
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this phase, a checkpoint meeting/email is required every two weeks. A catch-up meeting could be rearranged for clashes with exams at the end of March. 
        \item The student is expected to have some deliverable progress by mid-April.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Phase 3: Update the pre-training task for the proxy task
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The student is expected to have some deliverable progress by mid-may.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Phase 4: GUI implementation and final report
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The student is expected to have some deliverable progress by ten days of the project deadline.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
