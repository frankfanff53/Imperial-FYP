\section{Crohn's Disease}
Crohn's Disease \cite{baumgart2012crohn,crohnsNHS} is one of the primary types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) \cite{IBDCDC}, which is characterised by its chronic nature with inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as indicated in \autoref{fig:gi-tract} \cite{digestio98:online}. This condition can lead to long-term damage and complications, such as strictures, fistulas, and abscesses. Many people worldwide are struggling with IBD, and the management remains a challenge for medical professionals to address. A study from the University of Nottingham \cite{UoNResearch} reports that more than half a million individuals in the UK are affected by Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, another significant IBD subtype. Unlike Ulcerative Colitis, which is limited to the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease can potentially develop lesions anywhere within the GI tract. Consequently, patients may experience diverse symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, and weight loss.

Although numerous research initiatives have been undertaken \cite{hoarau2016bacteriome,feuerstein2021aga}, the precise aetiology of Crohn's disease remains elusive, rendering it incurable. However, fortunately, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can alleviate patients' symptoms and substantially improve their quality of life. Various diagnostic methods are employed by clinicians, such as enteroclysis, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and radiographic techniques (including barium contrast X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) to assist in the early diagnosis of the disease. MRI has become increasingly popular among radiographic techniques due to its non-invasive nature and enhanced imaging capabilities compared to CT. Nevertheless, manual MRI scan analysis remains a challenge since it is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Additionally, medical experts must examine each scan slice by slice painstakingly.

\section{Motivation}

The advancement of Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies, notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers powerful means for automatic feature extraction from input imaging data, thereby supporting medical professionals in diagnostic tasks. One crucial aspect of Crohn's Disease diagnosis is the examination of the terminal ileum (T.I.). Holland et al.'s study \cite{holland2019automatic} in 2019 proposed a residual network specifically targeting the terminal ileum to facilitate automated detection of Crohn's Disease using MRI scans. The authors claimed that the efficacy of their framework was contingent upon the degree of localisation during the preprocessing stage. Consequently, they advocated for incorporating terminal ileal ground-truth segmentations to enhance the localisation of the terminal ileum and improve the performance of automated detection techniques.

In a subsequent study, Abidi et al. \cite{Ali2022} advanced this line of research by developing an innovative deep-learning tool based on the nnU-Net architecture \cite{isensee2021nnu}. This approach enabled the automatic localisation of critical regions, particularly the terminal ileum, essential for radiologists during diagnostic assessments. The researchers addressed the previously identified limitations regarding the high dependence on localisation during the preprocessing phase \cite{holland2019automatic}. Furthermore, their findings established a solid foundation for a multi-class terminal ileum segmentation algorithm that combines transfer learning strategies with the nnU-Net architecture.

Inspired by the insights from \cite{holland2019automatic, Ali2022}, this project aims to create a binary segmentation model capable of accentuating terminal ileum regions more accurately by incorporating advanced transfer and semi-supervised learning methodologies. The successful accomplishment of this objective will significantly aid clinicians in diagnosing Crohn's disease, ultimately contributing to enhanced patient outcomes.

\section{Machine Learning Challenges}

The efficacy of deep learning models is intrinsically linked to the training data's quality, quantity, and diversity. One of the principal challenges faced in this project is the limited availability of training data. The dataset at our disposal is relatively small, comprising only 233 patient cases, which pales compared to those utilised in other industry-leading deep learning systems. Furthermore, since the region of interest (ROI) occupies a minor portion of the MRI scan, additional preprocessing techniques, such as localisation and cropping, must be considered for enhancing the segmentation model's performance, as suggested by \cite{Ali2022}. Another major challenge is the necessity for manual segmentation by clinical experts to develop gold-standard labels or point-wise centerlines for patient data, which is a complex, laborious, and inefficient endeavour. Consequently, acquiring high-quality and abundant patient data and gold-standard annotations poses significant challenges.

To mitigate these concerns, we propose a proxy training task employing weak supervision to generate coarse-grained segmentation masks as a compromise for the scarcity of gold-standard segmentations. Upon completion of the proxy task, gold-standard segmentations will be integrated into the training process to produce the final segmentation model. However, prior research \cite{Ali2022} indicates that training from scratch using the nnU-Net framework for proxy tasks is inefficient due to long convergence times and unstable performance. Implementing transfer learning for proxy training \cite{jang2021effectiveness} or incorporating a related pre-training job may serve as potential solutions to address these limitations.

\section{Objectives}

The primary of this project is to leverage deep learning methodologies to construct a progressive terminal ileum segmentation model. To achieve this, we will draw upon prior research whilst incorporating sophisticated transfer and semi-supervised learning techniques. The specific objectives that inform our strategic approach include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model Implementation}: We aim to establish a nnU-Net-based baseline segmentation model. This endeavour will necessitate the integration of appropriate data preprocessing techniques to optimise model performance.

\item \textbf{Proxy Training Task Setup}: For data devoid of ground-truth annotations, we propose to generate coarse-grained weak masks based on precedents set by previous research. These masks serve as a foundation for establishing the proxy training task.

\item \textbf{Target Model Development}: After training the proxy model using the generated weak masks, we plan to use the proxy model in conjunction with fully annotated data to develop our target segmentation model. This target model will set the baseline for subsequent refinement.

\item \textbf{Model Refinement}: Once our baseline is set, we plan to enhance the generation of weak masks by integrating the SegmentAnything Model \cite{kirillov2023segany} from Meta AI. This will influence the training of a refined model, promising improved segmentation outcomes.

\item \textbf{Performance Evaluation}: An essential part of our project is monitoring and quantitatively evaluating the performance of all developed models. We will compare the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), scrutinise training efficiency, and assess the generalisation gap to ensure our models meet the established accuracy and efficiency standards.
